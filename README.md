# ActionSheet

This application provides a simple yet powerful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using SwiftUI. Users can view a list of items, add new items, edit existing items, and permanently delete items. We used the action sheet provided by SwiftUI for editing and deleting operations. You can see the initial and edited versions in the photos below.
